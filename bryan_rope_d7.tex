\subsection*{AMOUNT OF TIME AS AN ACTIVE RESEARCHER}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}

It is 5.5 years since I graduated with my highest educational qualification. From 2012 to the present I have been employed at 1.0 FTE without interruption. 

\subsection*{RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES}
\label{sec:orgheadline2}

From 2012-2015 I was an SEW Visiting Assistant Professor at UCSD. My role was 0.6 teaching, 0.4 research. For 2016-2017, I held Research Fellow positions at the ANU, Warwick University and the University of Queensland as well as a Riemman Fellow at Leibniz University. I had small teaching load of around 0.1 teaching, with the remaining 0.9 devoted to research. Currently I am funded by a DECRA at Macuqrie University for 2018-2020 with 0.8 time devoted to research under the DECRA and the remaining 0.2 to be distributed amongst teaching, administration and other projects such as the current proposal. I also hold a continuing Lecturer position at Macquarie which will become active in 2021 upon completion of the DECRA.

I received research mentoring from Prof. Ben Andrews throughout my PhD studies, and in the years after. I also had access to mentoring by leaders in the field, including Prof.'s Ben Chow, Lei Ni, Peter Topping and Joseph Grotowski over the past five years.

All of my appointments have provided access to library facilities, computing as well as opportunities for travel to conferences and other research institutions. I was awarded an AMS/Simons travel grant in 2014 that provided funding for such travel.

\subsubsection*{Research Impact}
\label{sec:orgheadline7}

\begin{itemize}
\item With Ben Andrews and in my PhD thesis I developed groundbreaking new techniques for deducing curvature control in geometric evolution equations using isoperimetric estimates. We used these to give the simplest proofs yet available for the fundamental convergence theorems for Ricci flow on the two-sphere \cite{MR2729306} and for curve shortening flow in the plane \cite{MR2794630,MR2843240}. I further extended the techniques to the Ricci flow on arbitrary closed surfaces \cite{Bryan}, providing a unifying approach to the Ricci flow on surfaces. This work has been referenced by others in lecture notes and theses as the most accessible approach to the convergence results. The second part of the current proposal on controlling extremal profiles as viscosity subsolutions seeks to extend these techniques further.

\item With Mohammad Ivaki, Julian Scheuer and Janelle Louie, I investigated Harnack inequalities are their applications to ancient solutions of curvature \cite{2017arXiv170307493B,bryanlouie,2016arXiv160401694B,2015arXiv150802821B,2015arXiv151203374B}. We provided the first examples of Harnack inequalities for hypersurface flows in non-Euclidean backgrounds and further obtained such inequalities for the intrinsic, fully non-linear cross curvature flow (subject to an integrability condition). Given that obtaining a Harnack inequality for the Ricci flow was a tremendous achievement involving extremely delicate analysis, coupled with the fact that the Ricci flow is not fully non-linear, the Harnack for the cross curvature flow should be seems Our work classifying ancient solutions of hypersurface flows in the sphere obtains extremely broad results applying to any parabolic flow. In this area, and more broadly in the study of fully non-linear PDE, typical assumptions are homogeneity and/or convexity/concavity of the flow speed. Our results require no such assumption, making use of a powerful and geometric parabolic Aleksandrov reflection technique.

\item With Lashi Bandara \cite{2017arXiv171209287B}, we have shown how to obtain the existence and regularity of heat kernels on smooth manifolds with geometric singularities (so called "rough metrics"). This work has just begun, but already is attracting attention among harmonic analysts as many researchers have been working hard on constructing heat kernels in lower regularity situations. Our new innovations open a whole new avenue of exploring this cutting edge field.
